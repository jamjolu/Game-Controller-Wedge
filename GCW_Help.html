      <h2>Game Controller Wedge Description</h2>
      <i>By Jim Luther</i><br>
      <a href="https://github.com/jamjolu/Game-Controller-Wedge">https://github.com/jamjolu/Game-Controller-Wedge</a><br>
      <br>
      <div align="left"> GCW is a tool for creating and executing macros
        that are triggered by pressing game controller buttons. It is
        very much like<a href="https://joytokey.net/en/"> Joy2Key</a> or
        <a href="https://xpadder.com/">XPadder</a>, but it is easier and
        has very capable macro abilities. With GCW you type a macro into
        a text field, and you are ready to try it.<br>
        <br>
        Is GCW useful for gamers? Maybe not. I think GCW responds too
        slowly for many gamers. But, it can do a lot of typing,
        clicking, program launching (and more) with a single button
        press which could be valuable to those who wish to minimize the
        effort to complete repetitive tasks, or as a tool for making
        activities more accessible and less tiring. It is possible that
        some gamers may find it useful.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        With GCW you can compose up to 12 macros that you can save as a
        “profile” that you name. You can create as many profiles as you
        like.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        Built-in commands allow you to run programs, open folders and
        known file types, open web pages, toggle through open windows,
        open active windows, and change profiles, click targets, and
        more.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;<br>
        <br>
        GCW is based on <a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/">Autohotkey
          V1.1</a>. The well known Autohotkey (AHK) scripting tool
        offers means for emulating keyboard and mouse actions,
        interacting with windows, and much more. It is frequently used
        to automate repetitive computer tasks.<br>

      This is the main GCW window where you define your macros, or issue
      commands.<br>

      GCW supports up to 12 macros you define which are triggered by
      joystick or gamepad buttons 1 through 12.<br>

      This smaller Test Joy Buttons window lets you test your
      macros/commands without a game controller. This window, when open,
      sits on top of other windows.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Use the Game Controller Control Panel in Windows to see how your
      game controller buttons are mapped. (Click the Properties button.)<br>

          Game Controller Control Panel" width="514" height="459"> <img

      A screen capture of the main pop-up for the Windows Game
      Controller Control Panel and an image of the Properties pop-up
      associated with the Game Controller control panel in Windows<br>
      <br>
      You can see those details and test your buttons in the Properties
      view.<br>
      <br>
      Another helpful tool is this AutoHotKey script that can give you
      additional information about a game controller including <i>which
        game controller number your controller identifies as:</i><br>

      <h3><b>Why use game controller buttons to launch macros?</b></h3>
      <br>
      Because game controller buttons are unlikely to cause things to
      happen in typical Windows applications - other than games.<br>

      The <b>DPad Mode</b> checkbox permits users to additionally
      employ the D-Pad on a game controller to activate macros 9, 10, 11
      and 12 as: Up, Right, Down and Left on the DPad respectively. This
      allows game controllers with fewer than 12 buttons to have more
      macro activation options. The “POV hat” as it is shown in the
      Windows Game Controllers control panel is mapped to the D-pad on
      some game controllers.&nbsp; On other gamepads, you may need to
      activate a special mode to get it to work with GCW. The <b>DPad
        status</b> is shown in the “Test Joy Buttons” window where:<br>
      <br>
      <div align="left">
        <ul>
          <li><b>DPad Not Active</b> means that the DPad Mode box is
            unchecked.</li>
          <li> <b>No Controller Present</b> means DPad Mode is checked,
            but no there is no game controller plugged in that will work
            with this version of GCW.</li>
          <li> <b>DPad Status:</b><b> -1</b> means DPad Mode is
            checked, and no direction button is pressed.<b>DPad Status:
              0 </b>means the DPad Mode is checked, and the Up button
            is pressed.</li>
          <li> <b>DPad Status: 9000</b> means DPad Mode is checked, and

            and the Left button is pressed.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      GCW responds only to Up, Right, Down and Left. button presses on
      the DPad. Buttons 9, 10, 11 and 12 remain active regardless of
      DPad Mode.<br>

      <h3><a name="Anatomy_of_a_Macro"></a>Anatomy of a Macro</h3>
      GCW&nbsp; uses <b>AutoHotkey</b> and requires that you adhere to
      the AutoHotkey conventions for the <a
        href="https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/v1/lib/Send.htm"><b>Send</b>
        command (at AHK site)</a><br>
      <br>
      <br>
      An Example:&nbsp; <b>^p{enter}</b><br>
      <br>
      This example opens the print dialog using the Ctrl-p key combo in
      many programs, followed by the Enter key which is a special
      character. You can also use {return} for the Enter key<br>
      <br>
      Pressing and holding the Control key for the key that follows is
      denoted by the ^ character. Keys like Alt, Shift, Ctrl and the
      Windows key are referred to as modifier keys.<br>
      <br>
      Special characters like tab, space (at the end or beginning of a
      macro), or backspace all need to be enclosed in braces as in:
      {left} for left arrow. Or, <b>{F11} </b>for the F11 key. <a
        href="https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/v1/lib/Send.htm#keynames"><b>See

          more about including special characters in your macros </b><b>here

          at the AHK site</a>.</b><br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Here is the list of modifier keys: (<a
        href="https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/v1/lib/Send.htm#Parameters"><b>More
          about modifier keys here at the AHK site</b></a>)<br>

      <br>
      + = Shift&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      You can combine modifiers as in:<b> ^!{down}</b> which reads as
      Ctrl-Alt-(down arrow). This combo may turn your display upside
      down on some Windows computers! <b>^!{up}</b> can restore your
      display.<br>

      <br>
      <br>
      You can press a special character key multiple times by adding a
      number to the special character:<b> {tab 3}</b> (3 tabs).<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      Use the insert key to create around a 3 second delay: Now<b>{ins
        150}</b> Later (There is also a <b>{SLEEP} </b>command covered
      in the next section.)<br>
      <br>
      GCW sends keys faster than you can type, so delays may help a
      program to catch up to your macro.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      You can click at particular screen coordinates: <b>{click 150,

          site.</b></a><br>
      <br>
      To help you to determine your cursor position, GCW has a built-in
      hotkey sequence: <b>Alt-m</b> opens a tooltip note with the
      coordinates. The coordinates are also copied to the clipboard. Use
      <b>Ctrl-Alt-m </b> to hide the tooltip note.<br>

      <br>
      <br>
      <h3> <a name="Special_Commands"></a>Special Commands</h3>
      In addition to the standard AHK special characters, GCW offers its
      own special commands.<br>
      <br>
      <h4> Aliased AutoHotkey Commands:</h4>
      <br>
      <div align="left"> <b>{R}</b> - invokes the AHK Run command. The
        {R} command can open websites, programs, known file types and
        folders as long as you follow the {R} with a correct file path,
        or URL. Try this example: <b>{R}https://duckduckgo.com/</b> <br>
        <br>
        <b>{SLEEP} </b>- Allows you to pause GCW activity to allow for
        programs to open, and other processes to complete before
        reactivating GCW to continue sending macro text or commands. To
        do this, follow the {SLEEP} command with a number representing
        milliseconds. So, <b>{SLEEP}5000</b> would pause GCW activities
        for 5 seconds.<br>
        <br>
        <b>{AW}</b> - Activate an open Windows window. This command
        allows you to jump to a window based on any text that appears in
        the title bar of a window.&nbsp; To do this follow the {AW}
        command with some text that matches text in the window title.
        The text does not have to be the complete title, just any part
        of it. For example, <b>{AW}Calc</b> will activate the
        Calculator app (if it was open). Just be sure that the text is
        unique to the window you hope to activate.<br>
        <br>
        <b>{S}</b> - Suspend other GCW buttons until the macro for this
        button has finished. Place this special command at the beginning
        of your macro and it will prevent other macros from executing
        concurrently.<br>
        <br>
        <b>{BEEP} </b>- Makes a short toot sound.<br>
      </div>
      <br>
      <h4> GCW Commands for listing existing profiles and windows:</h4>
      <div align="left"> <b>{LW}</b> - Displays a list of open windows.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>{LP} </b>- Displays a list of your profiles.<br>
        <br>
        <div align="center">
          <h4> GCW Specific Window Management</h4>
        </div>
        <b>{TJB}</b> - Opens the Test Joy Buttons window if it was
        dismissed or minimized<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>{GCW}</b> - Brings the main GCW window into the foreground<br>
      </div>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h4> GCW Commands for Profile and Windows Navigation:</h4>
      <b><a name="GP_"></a>{GP} </b>- Load a named profile where the
      exact profile name appears directly after the {GP} command. For
      example, <b>{GP}Game Controller Wedge</b> will load the default
      profile. You could use this command to make a table of contents
      profile that links to other profiles.<br>
      <br>
      <div align="left"> <b>{Home}</b> - Return to the default Game
        Controller Wedge profile<br>
      </div>
      <br>
      <br>
      <div align="left"> <b>{NP}</b> - Loads the next profile on your
        list.<br>
        <br>

      <h3> <a name="Combining_Commands_and_Macro_Strings"></a>Combining
        Commands and Macro Strings!</h3>
      <br>
      <br>
      You can combine special commands and macro strings in any of the
      12 macro slots by separating the commands and/or macros with the
      pipe character:<b> </b>|<br>
      Commands and macro strings can be combined in any order, and you
      can include as many as you want (I really don’t know for sure what
      the limit is.) The actions will be carried out in left to right
      order, triggered by a single button press.<br>
      <br>
      For example:<br>
      <br>
      <b>{S}|{R}Calc|{SLEEP}1000|{AW}Calc|55{+}66{enter}</b><br>
      <br>
      You can interpret this combo macro example as:<br>
      First, it prevents other macros from interfering with this one.
      Then it opens the Calculator app, waits 1 second, makes sure the
      calculator window is active, and finally it requests the result of
      55 + 66.<br>
      <br>
      Note that the + sign has to be enclosed in braces because it is
      also a <i>special modifie</i>r character.<br>
      <br>
      <i><b>Add a comment to your macro!</b></i> - You could combine
      macros as in: <b>^w|</b><b>{--Close browser tab}</b> This macro
      closes the current browser tab and is followed by a pseudo command
      that acts as a comment. In this case, pseudo command is ignored
      because it is not a known special command, special character, or
      special modifier. The double minus sign is not used in special
      commands and acts as a visual cue.<br>

      GCW and AutoHotkey can emulate keyboard and mouse actions and send
      them to most active windows, or the Windows operating system. But
      there are applications that it will not be able to interact with
      at all, or not very well.<br>
      <br>
      In particular, in Windows 11 the new Notepad behaves really
      weirdly. If you send text to it from GCW or other AutoHotKey
      scripts, it frequently misses some of the sent characters. This is
      a quirk in Notepad I believe is related to the AI functions it now
      offers. I believe the AI function periodically interrupts the
      stream of inputs from AutoHotKey to Notepad. You can always
      download any one of the many Notepad alternatives to test your GCW
      macros.<br>
      <br>
      Also, I was unable to use the {click} command to reactivate Voice
      Access in Windows 11 in “Microphone off” mode. Nor would GCW
      respond at all while Voice Access was “Listening”. It seems that
      Voice Access will totally preempt GCW (and AutoHotKey). <a

      Amazon prices change all the time, so consider the above prices as
      approximate.<br>
      <div align="left"> Item 1 is a wireless controller, but not
        Bluetooth, that has a familiar layout and a decent price.<br>
        <br>
        Item 2 is the well known XBox Adaptive Controller that comes
        with its own remapping app to assign gamepad buttons of any of
        the 3.5mm inputs. The inputs are standard for common ability
        switches like the Ablenet Jelly Bean or the Orby Switch<br>
        <br>
        Item 3 looks like it is based on the same or similar hardware as
        many other "Leverless" controllers. They all use swappable
        keyboard type keys for buttons, but no inputs for 3.5mm ability
        switches.<br>
        <br>
        Item 5 - Carry your game controller in your pocket. It looks
        like it can support all 12 macro slots in DPad Mode.<br>
        <br>
        Item 6 -A low cost, DIY option that lets you play with the
        button layout as you please. It comes with 10 buttons, a USB
        controller board, wires with connectors to connect switches and
        the USB board, and a digital joystick.<br>

      Click the green “<b>Code</b>” button.<br>
      Click the “<b>Download ZIP</b>” option<br>
      Once downloaded, <b>extract the zip file</b> (right-click and
      choose “Extract all”.)<br>
      Look inside the folder “<b>Game Controller Wedge-main</b>”.<br>
      Copy the inner folder “<b>Game Controller Wedge-main</b>” and
      paste it wherever you like.<br>
      Inside the inner Game Controller Wedge-main folder you will find
      everything needed to run GCW. GCW does not require installation.
      Inside the folder you will find both executable applications:
      GCW.exe and GCW2.exe. If you double-click either of them you will
      likely see:<br>
      <br>

        unrecognized, risky file" width="356" height="330"><br>
      <br>
      To be safe you can use your virus protection software to scan the
      contents of Game Controller Wedge-main to reassure yourself that
      it is OK to run the executable. Then click the “More info” link,
      followed by clicking the "Run anyway” button.<br>
