GCW is a **Windows only** tool for creating and executing macros that are triggered by pressing game controller buttons.  It is very much like Joy2Key or XPadder. Type a macro into a text field, and you are ready to try it. Macros can send text, issue key sequences like Ctrl-p, perform mouse clicks at coordinates, and more.
Built in commands allow you to run programs, open folders and known file types, toggle through open windows, change profiles.

**There are now 2 versions of Game Controller Wedge** - One for Joystick/Game Controller 1, and one for Joystick/Game Controller 2 - gcw.exe or gcw.ahk, and gcw2.exe or gcw2.ahk respectively. Both versions are basically identical except that they respond to a controllers that report as #1 or #2 respectively. You can use this Autohotkey script to find out what your controller identifies as: https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/v1/scripts/index.htm#ControllerTest  
You can use 2 controllers simultaneously as long as you are running GCW and GCW2 with controllers that identify as #1 and #2. Each version of GCW has separate setting files. The different versions present different colored windows blue for GCW and yellow for GCW2. The title bar also has a 1 or 2 in it to distinguish the two versions.

You can compose up to 12 macros that you can save as a profile that you name and save. You can create as many profiles as you like. 

GCW is based on Autohotkey V1.1. The well known Autohotkey (AHK) scripting tool offers  means for emulating  keyboard and mouse actions, interacting with windows, and much more. It is frequently used to automate repetitive computer tasks.

**Please keep all the materials in the GCW folder together - if you donâ€™t, you will experience a ton of error messages**

Download a zip file with everything you need to run GCW by clicking the green **Code** button and selecting the download zip option.

GCW also includes a window so that you can test or run macros without a game controller. The "Test Joy Buttons" window appears on top of other windows when it is open.
Refer to GCW_help.pdf for a more complete discussion about GCW and how to use it.

GCW is made using AutoHotKey V1.1. The executables GCW.exe and GCW2.exe were made using AHK2exe.ahk. These executables should be opened in the same folder as the rest of the GCW related files  as they require either gcw.ini or gcw2.ini and the GCW_help.pdf to work properly without errors. Windows will warn you that the GCW.exe or GCW2.exe programs are suspicious. Please scan them with your preferred malware scanner, or install AutoHotkey V1.1 and run either of the GCW.ahk or GCW2.ahk scripts instead.
