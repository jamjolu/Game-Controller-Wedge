GCW is a tool for creating and executing macros that are triggered by pressing game controller buttons.  It is very much like Joy2Key or XPadder. Type a macro into a text field, and you are ready to try it.

You can compose up to 12 macros that you can save as a “profile” that you name. You can create as many profiles as you like. 
.
Built in commands allow you to run programs, open folders and known file types, toggle through open windows, change profiles, 

GCW is based on Autohotkey V1.1. The well known Autohotkey (AHK) scripting tool offers  means for emulating  keyboard and mouse actions, interacting with windows, and much more. It is frequently used to automate repetitive computer tasks.
